## Overview
RadonPy is the first open-source Python library for fully automated calculation for a comprehensive set of polymer properties, using all-atom classical MD simulations. For a given polymer repeating unit with its chemical structure, the entire process of the MD simulation can be carried out fully automatically, including molecular modelling, equilibrium and non-equilibrium MD simulations, automatic determination of the completion of equilibration, scheduling of restarts in case of failure to converge, and property calculations in the post-process step. In this release, the library comprises the calculation of 15 properties at the amorphous state.

## Requirement
- Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- LAMMPS >= 3Mar20
- rdkit >= 2020.03
- psi4 >= 1.5
- resp
- dftd3
- mdtraj >= 1.9
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Installation and usage
User manual and conda packages are currently in preparation.

[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/radonpy-pypi/) is available, but Psi4 can not be installed by pip install.

[PDF file](https://github.com/RadonPy/RadonPy/blob/develop/docs/RadonPy_tutorial_20220331.pdf) of RadonPy tutorial is available.

### Installation for conda (for Psi4 >= 1.8):
1. Create conda environment
```
conda create -n radonpy python=3.11
conda activate radonpy
```

2. Installation of requirement packages by conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge/label/libint_dev -c conda-forge -c psi4 rdkit psi4 resp mdtraj matplotlib
```

3. Installation of LAMMPS by conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge lammps
```

or manually build from source of [LAMMPS official site](https://www.lammps.org/).
In this case, the environment variable must be set:
```
export LAMMPS_EXEC=<Path-to-LAMMPS-binary>
```

4. Installation of RadonPy
```
pip install radonpy-pypi
```

### Installation for conda (for Psi4 <= 1.7):
1. Create conda environment
```
conda create -n radonpy python=3.9
conda activate radonpy
```

2. Installation of requirement packages by conda
```
conda install -c psi4 -c conda-forge rdkit psi4 resp mdtraj matplotlib
```

3. Installation of LAMMPS by conda
```
conda install -c conda-forge lammps
```

or manually build from source of [LAMMPS official site](https://www.lammps.org/).
In this case, the environment variable must be set:
```
export LAMMPS_EXEC=<Path-to-LAMMPS-binary>
```

4. Installation of RadonPy
```
pip install radonpy-pypi
```

### Installation from PyPI
RadonPy can be also installed by using only pip install. However, this intallation method can not install Psi4.

- Without LAMMPS installation
```
pip install radonpy-pypi
```
This is minimal installation of RadonPy. Many functions, such as polymer structure builder, force field assignment, force field descriptor, 
and tools for polymer informatics, are available, but automated DFT and MD simulations are not available.

- With LAMMPS installation
```
pip install radonpy-pypi[lammps]
```
MD simulations are available in this installation, but DFT calculations (conformation search, cherge calculation, and electronic property calculation) are not available.
